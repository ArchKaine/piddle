Piddle is a small program in the vein of wget and aria2.
I was unhappy with the usability of these two existing programs
and was faced with needing to write something for my final project
in my beginning programming class.  Thus Piddle was born.

I don't expect a ton of people to want to use this, that's okay,
I'm writing it for me :)

Simply run the program and follow the prompts.  More advanced features
are in development as is this README file.
